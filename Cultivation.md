Cultivation is the process by which a person gathers Essence Energy from the surroundings using a [[Cultivation Method]].  Cultivation slowly raises the capacity of one's Spiritual Sea as well as improves the bonds with ones' [[Companion]]s. 

Martial practitioners start in the Mortal Realm. They cultivate and slowly increase the capacity of their Spiritual Sea. But if they continue like this they will soon reach a bottleneck. This is because the [[Mortal Shackles]] prevent one from having strength beyond a limit. So once their spiritual sea is large enough, they immediately bind a Companion. Someone in Mortal Realm can only bind with a Common Companion. With the help of the Companion they then break the first Shackle and advance to Earth Realm.

Now in the Earth Realm they once again continue cultivating until they can bind the next Companion. Someone in Earth Realm can bind with a Rare Companion. This time they need to bind with 2 more Companions before they can break the second Shackle and advance to Heaven Realm. 

After breaking the second Shackle, they can use skills from two different Companions at the same time. In the Heaven Realm they need 3 more Companions to break the last Shackle. The first 2 can be Epic while the last can be Legendary.
